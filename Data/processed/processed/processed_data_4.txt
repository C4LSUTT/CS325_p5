I do love Pikachu. It's really cute. I just feel a little bad for Raichu. Processed
There Is no other pokemon that makes a better mascot than pikachu. Processed
The Pokemon itself is cute, it is the excessive, oversaturating, annoying use of it that makes it very susceptible to hate.

I hate it when people who don't play games or else just think of Pikachu, as if there wasn't any other character or monster worthy of mention.

That's it. Processed
Oversaturated Processed
Pichu's better Processed
pikachu is overrated, but i don't hate him. Processed
It‚Äôs just that pokemon only pays attenttion to it and all of kanto Processed
Pikachu is ok, but it annoys me that every generation we have to have another lazy pikachu clone that attempts to capitalize off that rat‚Äôs popularity. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so *eh* towards electric type because it seems like the only thing there are worse versions of pikachu Processed
Pikachu's super cute, just super overrated Processed
I really more hate how overused it is. You can only look at the yellow rat before you have the desire to shop for mouse traps Processed
[removed] Processed
I used to HATE the yellow rat with a passion. Especially when I returned to Pokemon in Gen 4.

Nowadays I am more indifferent to it. Maybe because it is so versatile even in an unevolved state. Still prefer Raichu over it though. Processed
Honestly call me lame, but Pikachu is always going to be my favorite Pok√©mon. Going off the fact that the first Pok√©mon I ever played through was Pok√©mon Yellow, and the fact that Ritchie had a Pikachu really just stuck with me. Now in every playthrough I have a Pikachu named Sparky. He‚Äôs kind of a burden sometimes but it‚Äôs worth it Processed
Great mascot. Needs more hats. Processed
He's a great mascot for sure. He's fine on his own, but I like Raichu a lot more. My chubby little prince Processed
Love Pikachu, but holy shit is it over-marketed. Every set of merch comes with a Pikachu, causing most Pok√©mon to be excluded due to constant favoritism. Pikachu itself is adorable and a great character in the anime, but it‚Äôs constantly plastered onto everything. Processed
Defo the middle option for me. I like Pikachu a lot! It's a great mascot and definitely did well for the series! It does get a lot of special attention, but that's understandable. (And admittedly, a lot of it's special attention, I find pretty cool, like the Cap Pikachus, G-Max Pikachu, etc.) But saying that, it's not the most outstanding Pokemon out there, since I prefer Raichu, and generally loads of other Pokemon. So it's no favourite of mine, but it's one I definitely appreciate and have a liking to! :) Processed
I mean there is always going to be haters for everything popular so I think the hate is normal and I don't think it's a bad Pok√©mon just that I don't like it too much Processed
I love Pikachu and it‚Äôs evolutionary line a whole lot. Pikachu is a perfect mascot for the series. Plus they‚Äôre just so cute! Processed
I'm more of the indigo league of pokemon. didn't watch the other series. I think Pikachu is pretty cool and can prove he can fight even up to a raichu Processed
I love pikachu, I actually got introduced to Pokemon by the anime when I was really young and I always loved him. I have a lot of favourite Pokemon but he‚Äôll always have a place in my heart because he‚Äôs one of the few pop culture characters that I‚Äôve carried with me my whole life so far, he was always the one I‚Äôd use as an imaginary friend as a kid, and I know a lot of people write others off for saying Pikachu is their favourite, but what the heck eh? I also main him in smash bros. It‚Äôs all personal preference so I don‚Äôt get why anyone cares too much. Processed
I don't like Pikachu because of it's behaviour in anime. It behaves just like loli, which makes me almost in every scene of his sick. Also I think he has too much attention in the universe, where you can find tens or hundreds of pokemons, which are much more interesting. But that's PoV of super new person. Processed
It is a good mascot, but super overrated. Almost more overrated as charizard. ALMOST. nothing is more overrated then Charizard Processed
Pikachu is cool I love raichu definitely one of my favourites, the people who hate Pikachu for the most part just want to be "edgy and original" because "Pikachu is to mainstream" it's the hipster mentality, and then there are the ones who are genuinely sick of Pikachu being shoved down your throat but I'd argue wouldn't you just get sick of pokemon in general not that specific 1, that argument holds for the people who hate the Pikachu "clones" wouldn't you hate the clones not the OG? ah well. Processed
I honestly think Charmander should have been the mascot. Processed
[deleted] Processed
It‚Äôs adorable, but I think Raichu and it‚Äôs Alolan Form would make a bit better mascots for the sole factor of being fully evolved. Processed
It's a neat Pok√©mon but I honestly prefer Raichu and almost all of the pikaclones (minus Emolga and Dedenne) over it Processed
I don‚Äôt hate Pikachu. I‚Äôm just sort of tired of it, and the endless waves of pointless imitators it‚Äôs inspired. (Emolga is cool though)

I also prefer round, chubby Pikachu to the new, sporty looking one. >_> Processed
Don't care for Pikachu but don't hate him always loved raichu more Processed
The way that it‚Äôs been shoved down our throats for eight generations now is what made me hate it. I didn‚Äôt use to mind it so much but now I roll my eyes whenever I see Pikachu. Pichu and Raichu are fine though. It‚Äôs just Pikachu that I can‚Äôt stand. Processed
Amazing mascot...not so hot in game in recent years.

But pikachu is the one and only mascot. Processed
It‚Äôs a good mascot for the series and I like it, but it‚Äôs not one of my favourite Pok√©mon overall Processed
I‚Äôm kinda partial :) Processed
Pikachu is a really good mascot, but as a kid I was always annoyed that Ash didn‚Äôt evolve him because I thought Raichu looked cooler. Not evolving Pikachu is actually 100% of the reason I haven‚Äôt played Pok√©mon Let‚Äôs go Pikachu or Eevee, it would just feel weird to have a team of big strong pok√©mon like Blastoise, Charizard, Venusaur and then a cute little yellow/brown guy like Pikachu or Eevee Processed
Alolan Raichu üòé >>>>>> Pikachu Processed
I like it. Think it definitely makes sense as the mascot. Still more of a Raichu guy tho (any form, also give us a mega Raichu based on Gorochu if and when megas come back please and thanks). Processed
Can't really hate Pikachu since it evolves into Raichu Processed
Pikechu is a pretty good mascot, but if it wasn't the mascot it would probably be forgotten. Processed
I love Pikachu, but I'm never gonna use one without planning to evolve it. In every party I've had a pikachu the little bastard gets one hit KOed all the time Processed
[deleted] Processed
Unironically love Pikachu. In my top 3 favorite gen 1 mons I would say. Processed
raichu gets left in the dust because of it, so idk Processed
It's way too overrated. Just like charizard and mewtwo Processed
People are fine with pikachu but just can‚Äôt accept that game freak is making charizard the secondary mascot Processed
Honestly I don't care, I'll be fine unless Floatzel gets hated Processed
Mimikyu is better Processed
Homie ppl don‚Äôt hate pikachu or should hate it (we should hate charizard) even thou it‚Äôs not on my top 100 favourite Pkmn it‚Äôs ideal and perfect for Pok√©mon Processed
Funny little mouse guy Processed
Pretty indifferent. No reason to be upset that the thing that represents the brand continues to represent the brand. Seems as odd as being upset that McDonald's still has the golden arches.

Only thing that would make me hate Pikachu is if they stuck one in my party and wouldn't let me box it. Processed
Its cute, its electric, its overrated, but i love raichu, alolan even more. Processed
The reason I have any negative feelings at all towards pikachu is because I feel the pikachu used as a mascot of pokemon is a worse design than the pikachu in the manga - specifically, Red's pikachu and Yellow's pikachu Processed
My first question...who hates Pikachu....? Processed
Pikachu is a great mascot and I don‚Äôt think any other Pokemon should replace him, but he isn‚Äôt the best Pokemon in the world. Processed
Taking into account that pikachu was one of the first electric type Pok√©mon introduced into the anime it‚Äôs bubbly personality really caught the attention of kids and adults alike. Also the fact that electric types
Only have one weakness (ground) makes it so much more appealing to have on a team. Processed
At least pikachu isn't Eevee. Processed
Pretty much perfect for the face of the franchise.

My only issue with it is by existing Raichu will forever be irrelevant in GameFreaks eyes.

Alolan Raichu was a mistake and only happened so Pikachu could be a part of the new regional variant gimmick without being changed itself. Processed
Pikachu is a great mascot imo. There are a lot of other Pok√©mon that would also work, but Pikachu is simple enough to be iconic and memorable. Bright yellow cute thing with red circle cheeks. Easy to draw, easy to recognize, etc. He works! Also he‚Äôs cute how tf would someone not like Pikachu. R U GUYS JEALOUS OF PIKACHU HMMMMM Processed
I just dont like how many there are and how exclusive some of those variants are. I get why its like that, I just dont like it. Have the same problem with agumon and omnimon from digimon. Processed
One thing that i think makes Pikachu so brilliant as a mascot is that it‚Äôs very gender-neutral. It‚Äôs yellow, a color which is not viewed as particularly ‚Äúboyish‚Äù or ‚Äúgirly‚Äù, and it‚Äôs both small and fuzzy while also very powerful, making it look entirely at home in scenes where it‚Äôs being cute and cuddly *and* in scenes where it‚Äôs kicking ass with aggressive electric shocks. Obviously most adults don‚Äôt quite care so much, but a lot of children can get very wrapped up in whether something is ‚Äúfor boys‚Äù or ‚Äúfor girls‚Äù, so giving a kid-focused franchise a non-gendered mascot was a very smart move. Processed
Cute, I get excited whenever I see it on anything but it‚Äôs definitely not my favorite or even top 10 Processed
Pikachu as a mascot if fine, it checks all the boxes it needs to. I just... Like Pichu a lot more I guess? And Raichu is, well, Raichu, abandonned by all. At least Galarian Raichu is cooler than Fat Orange Pikachu. Processed
Well, let's begin

1. Pikachu is mediocre in the games, even in Pok√©mon Yellow where he's the obligatory starter. And to make things worse you can't even evolve it to Raichu;
2. Many people, myself included, think his cuteness worn off with the overexposition and commercial saturation and became lame and annoying a long time ago;

2b. Which leads to all pikaclones who are hated for the same reason, kawaii appeal to sell merch, and made worse by them being knock-offs of a design we're already tired of;

3. Anime Pikachu is stupidly overpowered even for Ash's standard, and is often sadistic, malicious and mean-spirited, specially towards Meowth. Cats being abused in cartoons grinds my gears since I was a kid, that's why I always despised Tweety and Jerry. I love Meowth, Pikachu can choke;

4. Pikachu and Charizard take too much of the spotlight and it's frustrating as hell when your favorite Pok√©mon doesn't have goodies for it, or is dexed out from a game, you feel cheated by the yellow rat. Processed
I like pikachu a lot!He is a very cool and cute Pok√©mon,and he is good mascot.He is not very strong‚Ä¶unless he has light ball.One nasty plot and agility and you sweeped.But i still think raichu needs to get more attention too! Processed
Yea poor raichu, there was pokedex entry in moon or ultra moon that talks about how its rare to see raichu because everyone loves pikachu and that made me real sad :( Processed
I agree! Processed
Trubbish would've been a great mascot for SwSh^^^I ^^^kid^, ^^^I ^^^actually ^^^like ^^^gen ^^^8 Processed
I looked through all the gen 1 Pok√©mon (since those would be the only available ones for a mascot) and, aside from the obvious Eevee and *maybe* Meowth, the best I can see is Arcanine. Idk why Arcanine, but... yeah. Having a traditional starter be the mascot is super unfair to the other two so they‚Äôre out of the picture. Mew is a maybe. 

Honestly, Pikachu just *is* the best option for a mascot. Processed
I always thought eevee the evolution pokemon was the perfect symbol of the series. Had more significance than Pikachu in a lot of places. Pikachu is really cute and I think the fact that they chose eevee and Pikachu for the let's go games was the best choice. Processed
I agree with this. Even as a Gen 1 kid during the Pokemon craze, I was getting REAL tired of seeing Pikachu everywhere. So you could have imagined how I felt as a dumb kid with no regular internet access when I picked Yellow and realized I'd be FORCED to have Pikachu as a starter. Especially after having Eevee swiped from right in front of me (I really wanted it and seeing Jolteon nearly made me cry). I hated the little rat just as much as it hated me at the start of my first run. Journey somehow made fast friends of us and while there's no way to transfer mons from Gameboy games, it lives on in spirit as an Alolan Raichu now.

I still think it's an excellent mascot, though. Processed
I like it, but i appreciate pikachu and both raichu's more... im just not a fan of baby pokemon in general üòÖ Processed
I feel like this is an issue regarding kanto, of course pikachu will get focus because its the mascot, the kanto pandering is to much (coming from a day 1 fan which says a lot!) Processed
Almost every Pikachu clone exceeds Pikachu in something Imo (not counting Plusle and Minun), also I think that Morpeko is quite original since we never had before a Electric/Dark type pokemon Processed
Mimikyu's pretty cool, though Processed
Oh no please dont kill the guy ü§£ Processed
Lightball makes it usable ingame, ive done it and had no issues! as for competitive i dont really play so i cant say anything on that! Processed
I'm surprised they didn't just give it Speed Boost. Processed
Any reason why you hated it? Processed
Too true! Processed
Very well said! Processed
"Pikachu is like a loli" is a take that I didn't expect to be seeing today. Processed
Yeah pikachu clones make no sense to me, they could scrap them all and just plop pikachu in every game üòÖ Processed
I dont think they could have picked a starter tbh Processed
No, not trolling! And i wish i could be 13 again ü§£ why would you think that? Processed
I love this idea too, i feel like the only thing pikachu has on them is its color scheme, which is better then the brown raichu is rocking imo Processed
Yeah its starting to look like the posts ive seen were a vocal minority vs the community's actual opinion! Processed
The inspiration behind this post was me noticing an astonishing amount if posts over the years about how pikachu sucks or should be replaced... i thought the notion was crazy so i decided to get a grasp on the communities opinion through a poll! Clearly i was just seeing the vocal minority vs the actual majority Processed
LOL honestly they might be ü§£ Processed
For sure, if they had gone with clefairy like originally intended, things may have not panned out so well as it can be viewed as "feminine" out here in the west! Pikachu was definitely a perfect mix for young boys and girls alike! Processed
Damn, GF breaking the 4th wall just to shit on Raichu more :( Processed
Funny garbador is the only gmax that's not from gen 1or8 Processed
But the mascot would have to be from gen 1 because their wouldn't be a mascot for years. Processed
Some of the dev talks and interviews and such over the years seem to point to them initially wanting Clefairy to be the mascot. Funny because eventually it wasn't even as popular as other Normal (later Fairy) Gen 1 types like Jigglypuff and Chansey. Processed
It is and it isn't. It only evolves through special (non-level up) means so I could see how it might be misleading to new players if they think every pokemon needs special circumstances to evolve. Processed
Eevee looks too normal to represent the franchise though. Processed
You could bring your save file to the Virtual Console version and then bring it to Bank, but that requires a hacked 3DS. Processed
Same. I know the Pichu fans will hate me for this and I deserve it (I'm sorry), but I'd rather have gotter Gorochu back in Gen 2 than Pichu. Processed
They did my boy luxray dirty with that one. Hope they give luxray sonething to make him better in the next games Processed
Maybe because I thought it was was just a regular Pokemon given rock star status. 

Whenever someone not familiar with Pokemon would instantly recognise Pikachu. Despite there being other mascot Pokemon. 

This was back before Pokemon like Charizard and Mewtwo got 2 mega evolutions. Processed
A part of me needs an explanation to understand, but the rest of me doesn't want to know. Processed
But Pikachu IS a starter. üòí Processed
Even when they FINALLY did something for Raichu on the 20th anniversary with an Alolan form, they still shit on it. They refused to give it surf in the region where the sport was born and basically called it a poser in the dex entries. Processed
I know :( Processed
Pikachu only evolves through the Thunder Stone, so that's kind of a moot point. Processed
Yeah, I know. Just meant in the legitimate way. I was also one of those kids who didn't know his Pokemon were on a timer set by the game's internal battery and they live on in my memories now. Processed
LOL me too ü§£ but i also main pichu in smash so its a 50/50 for me Processed
Marill should have been a split Pikachu evolution, I will hold this opinion to my grave. Give us Pikablu dammit! Processed
I also though that Luxray is partially Dark type, but according to it's Latin part of the name it's associated with light instead, but I agree with you, I think Luxray deserved a mega evolution Processed
There's nothing Dark about its lore though other than I guess some people thinking it looks edgy? Processed
Yeah but he became one because of the anime's popularity, not because he was intended to be one, before the anime he was just a pokemon like any other one Processed
That‚Äôs BECAUSE he‚Äôs the mascot Processed
it even stands on its' own tail like a surfboard :( Processed
Yes, but the argument they were making for Eevee as mascot is that it specifically best represents evolution, which they believe to be the core aspect of the franchise. Pikachu was not chosen as mascot due to anything to do with evolution. In fact the anime specifically contradicts that with the whole 'love every pokemon, even weak ones who can't/don't want to evolve' message. Processed
Oh, that sucks. Processed
/u/jcdz77, I have found an error in your comment:

It might be better if you, jcdz77, had posted ‚Äúsmash so ~~its~~ [**it's**] a 50‚Äù instead. ‚ÄòIts‚Äô is possessive; ‚Äòit's‚Äô means ‚Äòit is‚Äô or ‚Äòit has‚Äô.

I feel bad for saying that because Pichu's adorable and it did nothing wrong, but did we REALLY need a baby pokemon before Pikachu? Couldn't Pichu just be the stand alone Pikaclone of Gen 2 (with Pikaclone stats, not baby stats, of cousre)? Processed
If they bring back megas in the gen 4 remakes luxray would be top of mylist to get one. Along with floatzel and staraptor. They were on my team in every playthrough lol.

How lopunny got one over any of those 3 beats me. Processed
I guess Lopunny got mega due to Dawn/Platinum having that pokemon or it's pre-evolved form in anime/manga

Judging from Luxray's overall moves, I hope it's possible mega gets dual Electric/Dark typing Processed
Yeah. Although its movepool is pretty good. Luxray's problem is having neither the bulk or the speed to complement it's good attack stat. 120 base attack is nothing to scoff at. But Sp.A being its next best stat at 95 hurts. 80 hp and 79/79 defences aren't that strong, although intimidate helps remedy it somewhat and 70 isn't helpimg it much either. Guts boosts its attack to 180 base so that i can hitlike a truck. Give it 40 speed and 20 in botg defenses and hp and i'll be happy. Make its ability  as a mega just its nornal intimidate as its too hard to activate guts holding a mega stone. Processed
