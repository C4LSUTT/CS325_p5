Comment: Defo the middle option for me. I like Pikachu a lot! It's a great mascot and definitely did well for the series! It does get a lot of special attention, but that's understandable. (And admittedly, a lot of it's special attention, I find pretty cool, like the Cap Pikachus, G-Max Pikachu, etc.) But saying that, it's not the most outstanding Pokemon out there, since I prefer Raichu, and generally loads of other Pokemon.

Comment: Pikachu is cool I love raichu definitely one of my favourites, the people who hate Pikachu for the most part just want to be "edgy and original" because "Pikachu is to mainstream" it's the hipster mentality, and then there are the ones who are genuinely sick of Pikachu being shoved down your throat but I'd argue wouldn't you just get sick of pokemon in general not that specific 1, that argument holds for the people who hate the Pikachu "clones" wouldn't you hate the clones not the OG? ah well.

Comment: One thing that i think makes Pikachu so brilliant as a mascot is that it’s very gender-neutral. It’s yellow, a color which is not viewed as particularly “boyish” or “girly”, and it’s both small and fuzzy while also very powerful, making it look entirely at home in scenes where it’s being cute and cuddly *and* in scenes where it’s kicking ass with aggressive electric shocks. Obviously most adults don’t quite care so much, but a lot of children can get very wrapped up in whether something is “for boys” or “for girls”, so giving a kid-focused franchise a non-gendered mascot was a very smart move.

Comment: I agree with this. Even as a Gen 1 kid during the Pokemon craze, I was getting REAL tired of seeing Pikachu everywhere. So you could have imagined how I felt as a dumb kid with no regular internet access when I picked Yellow and realized I'd be FORCED to have Pikachu as a starter. Especially after having Eevee swiped from right in front of me (I really wanted it and seeing Jolteon nearly made me cry).
