Why limits ourselves to the 16 Pro? I want to hear some juicy iPhone 20 Pro rumours Processed
Only thing I want is better battery life for the smaller model Processed
Am I the only one that would find it a bit hard to believe that they would add another button 2 years in a row? Processed
As someone who's skipping out on the 15 I'm actually interested in hearing about the 16 Processed
I just wish the iPhone was a bit taller. —Nobody Processed
Capture button? Phones have really peaked if they are coming up with stupid stuff like that. Processed
Frankly looks.. very dull. I hope there’s more in the pipeline. There’s very little to entice a user to move from 13 or older series phones. 

I’d atleast hope for a 10x telephoto for the 16 PM, but that doesnt seem to be happening. Processed
They should bring back iPhone minis. Processed
The carousel never ends. Processed
Better battery life pls Processed
One of the other usual sources has a couple of other rumours, too. 

First that they're going to introduce a new model called the "Ultra", which will be bigger (and that's got another rumour of being portless, but I'll believe that when I see it especially given that they've given in on USB-C).

There's also rumours of capacitive buttons, which they were apparently trying to have ready for the 15. These are "buttons" which aren't mechanical. They don't move but instead give haptic feedback so it feels like you've physically pressed something.

If any of these rumours are at all true, then it looks like Apple is trying to increase water/dustproofing. Which could be in-line with creating an "Ultra" version of the phone to be in line with the watch. Processed
This article annoys me. It talks about 5G A. Look the carrier have not even fully developed and deployed regular 5G or SA. Except maybe t mobile. And they are already talking about 6G. Jesus let the tech catch up before getting people talking about the next standard. We are a good 10 years before 6G would even be a thought and probably 2 to 4 years before 5G is fully deployed and operation on an all carrier level. Processed
 I like the battery life on the 17 better. Processed
All these rumours and they’ll prolly end up giving the same phone with one little gimmick here and a new one there. Increase in price is mandatory Processed
Only just bought the 15 pro max ffs Processed
Just make them stop overheating when you go outside Processed
If the only new features would be a 0.2 inch size increase and another button it might be the lamest upgrade of all time, but honestly it’s expected as upgrades are only going to be more and more incremental each year, long gone are the big must-have upgrades such as the iPhone X. Processed
I’m still waiting on my 15pro and max preorders.

And we see rumors about the 16 ? Processed
My source tells me they’re targeting the iPhone 20 Pro to be faster, have the latest wireless technology, and better cameras. Processed
I’ll give you a sneak peek: 

iPhone XX

•A22 “Pro Bionic” chip that is 10% faster than the A21 in the iPhone 18 Pro Ultra. The fastest chip ever in a smartphone. 

•Removal of USB-C and physical buttons to make it a slab. Something something courage. 10 minute long talk about how it was the most ambitious thing Apple has ever did. Because of this, no cable in the box, no paper or Apple stickers, just the phone and box. IP69 resistance. Something something first ever carbon neutral phone. 

•Battery life on the XX is 24 hours of video playback. Best battery life ever on an iPhone thanks to the efficiency of the A22 Pro Bionic chip. Insert comparison sheet showing the iPhone 15 Pro having 23 hours to show how the battery improved over the years 

•”All new design” with titanium and 5% more rounded edges. 

•MagSafe transfer - some new technology that allows Apple to wirelessly move data through MagSafe; only available through the MagSafe thunderbolt which is $129.99 Processed
It will be the best, fastest and most advanced iPhone ever created when it is released. Processed
The iPhone 20 Pro is going to be an iPhone. Processed
Better battery life in general. That would be the next big leap in the smartphone. Imagine week long battery life. Processed
Put 120hz refresh on the smaller model so that it can have 60hz down to 1hz for battery life. Processed
That won't come until the iphone 26. Processed
I would give it 50-50 as in I would neither be surprised if they did nor if they didn’t. The 11 series smart battery cases had a dedicated camera button which was actually pretty handy.

I can see that they wouldn’t necessarily want to add more physical buttons to the iPhone, but if they’re able to set up a capacitive button, then why not? Processed
Technically they replaced a slider with a button this time. So I don’t think it would be crazy. Processed
Just several months ago the rumors said they will remove all buttons and replace it with touch sensitive sides. Processed
Same. Processed

If it hides the dynamic island in 18:9 videos I'm all in. Processed
Narrower but taller like all the other phones out there would be great. Processed
Did you really not notice that phones hit a technological plateau in the past 4-5 years? Processed
What's more likely is that it's the same button with deeper functionality. For example, when in the camera app, perhaps applying slight pressure to the button will result in engaging focus. Processed
lol they already gave us an action button, I’m not even sure what this would be Processed
Remember that they have to digital zoom the gap between 2x and 5x as-is. I feel like 10x is too big of a jump for that. You’d have some very blurry, like, 8x photos that then snap to completely clear at 10x haha.

The only alternative would be to put in a massive 100MP sensor or something for the main lens. But I can’t see Apple doing that. They tend to prefer better light capture over sheer megapixels, so the lens itself would have to be massive.

EDIT: I suppose they could also put a 48MP sensor in the 5x zoom lens, which could then crop. That would be an interesting, albeit expensive, possibility… But I honestly see them doing this first in the ultra-wide for the high-res spatial video application. Processed
Honestly, all I’m hoping for the 16 is a general refinement, and fixing the issues the 15 has. If the 16s have a more efficient chip, better battery life, better cameras and the 16 Pro gets the 5x tetraprism camera, I’ll be happy. Processed
don't worry you can use it for 12 months before it's outdated Processed
Overall, I agree. I do think Dynamic Island, not as a clever trick to hide the hole punch, but in terms of live activities, is pretty neat. But I know that’s an opinion with variable mileage.

So until we hit under screen cameras which I think would be for 2027 at the earliest… Processed
Wait… you don’t mean… so you’re saying that the iPhone 20 Pro is going to be the best iPhone they’ve ever made when they will release it?? Processed
But will it have USB C? 🤔 Processed
Is it really that hard to plug in your phone though? Like having a FULL day battery life, and by that I mean 16-20 hours of screen on time would be amazing. Never need to worry even on the longest day. But I can’t see a reason to need a whole week Processed
> Imagine week long battery life.

This will never happen, ever.

If they could make it last a week, they could also make it faster/smaller/more features instead, and consumers will overwhelmingly prefer the latter. Processed
120hz is and has always been on the smaller model Processed
Seems like he/she/it did! Processed
iPhone peaked in 2017 with X. Processed
I would argue even before that. What's the deal every year?

New features to the OS? Check

Your camera is better than last year's camera? Check

You put a new more powerful chip that's more powerful than last chip in it, power that most users will never use or notice? Check

Maybe a slight hardware design change but really you're still playing around with glass rectangles? Check

Only thing really happened is that phones got bigger since after the days of the iPhone 5 and the Android phones of the time, and we got foldables now which are just a combo phone/tablet, the real "phablet".
 
Louis Rossman said it best in response to one of his chat members when the chat member asked was he going to watch the Samsung event one year

"Why do I need to watch that?  It's the same thing every year they tell you the new phone is more powerful and the camera is better" Processed
> For example, when in the camera app, perhaps applying slight pressure to the button will result in engaging focus.   

I'm fairly certain my old Nokia Lumia 930 (rip Windows Phone) had that feature. Processed
Not that expensive; google of all companies already does that. Processed
S23 Ultra has both a 3x and 10x telephoto. I think the implication would be adding a 4th lens, rather than relying on computation. Processed
13 series was peak. 120hz, Major battery jumps, major camera jumps, major performance jumps. 

Since the 13 l they have made no improvements in battery, some would argue regressed. Performance hasn’t been pushing the envelope, the 15 brought good camera improvements. 

Overall the 13 pro max had the most improvements in a single release. Processed
Yes, and they think you will love it. Processed
Next week. These rumors of a release when the 15 just came out are silly. Processed
D. It’ll have USB-D. Processed
Ah yes, our typical r/apple poster.

Why do you want more ram, don't you know iphone has memory management? Why do you want more storage, don't you use cloud? Why do you want 120hz, don't you know human eyes can't see it? And the beauty of why do you want all week battery life, don't you charge your phone daily?

The tone always changes when apple comes out with the feature, and then it's revolutionary. 

Amazing. Processed
It’s not but technology has to progress isn’t it? I would rather have a week long battery life than an octagonal prism camera that shows all my subjects nose hairs in excruciating detail. Processed
I think it’s bigger than that. What about Apple’s “going green” narrative? Wouldn’t one charge a week per iPhone conserve monstrous amount of energy vs daily charges? 

On top of that, the battery would have significantly less cycles over time. It’d last longer. Less electronic waste. Just some food for thought though — I’m sure we’re a long ways away. Processed
*iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini have entered the chat* Processed
Long ago my Droid X had a dedicated camera button that did this. It was okay. Processed
I knew the pixel 7 pro had a 48MP telephoto lens, but they compromised quite heavily on the aperture to get to that. The 8 Pro seems to basically be caught up to the 15PM telephoto on that front, though, even with a 48MP sensor. Interesting. I wonder if that advancement in aperture caught Apple off guard. 

A 16PM with triple 48MP sensors at today’s apertures would be an absolute beast both for 10x optical zoom and 4K spatial video (cropped wide angle plus the main lens) — while maintaining that low light performance that Apple seems to always be very concerned about.

I could definitely see them doing that for the 16PM if they’ve figured it out by then since Google is forcing their hand. And my tangential prediction is then that the 15’s spatial video will probably be limited to 1080p since the 12MP wide sensor will need to be cropped. Then the 48MP jump for the wide angle will allow 4K for the next gen, and 60fps for the gen after that (because you know Apple likes their software-gated incrementalism lol). Processed
USB D eez nutssss Processed
People have forgotten or probably are not old enough to used those Nokia phones that lasted 2-3 days and how it used to feel Processed
Nah, i want more ram, more storage, thinks I actually use on my phone. I’d like longer battery life, but only to the point of 1 or 2 days. I don’t gain anything from only charging once a week. It’s so easy to set it on a MagSafe charger I don’t see what you gain? 5 seconds every evening? It’s undoubtedly better to have a week long battery than not, but no one offers that. And the reason why is the tradeoffs are way too high for your average user. If you want a week long battery then get an old Nokia and use that😂 Processed
Well that's fine. But I do think your average customer prefers an amazing camera vs the "convenience" of only charging once a week. It's not that hard to just plug in the phone IMO. Build the best phone possible and just make the battery last for the longest day imaginable but no more. Processed
I'd probably be want a better camera, I can always plug in for battery or have a battery back up. Just my opinion. Processed
The camera has a long, long way to go. The battery life doesn’t. Processed
Well it would in theory consume the same amount of power either way. Say 1 unit of power 7 times in 7 days. Or 7 units of power in 1 days that then last for 7 days. It would keep batteries lasting longer bc as you say fewer cycle counts. But I don’t think most people are actually replacing their phone because of the battery being bad, they could replace just the battery. I would like a longer battery life sure but I just don’t think that’s a game changer. It’s easy enough to charge the phone every other day or every day that it’s not a huge advantage Processed
Gottem. Processed
How bout just doing both? It doesn’t have to be either or. Kinda weird mentality to ask someone how convenient it is to plug ones phone in daily. Kinda like just saying how convenient is it to just walk everywhere instead of inventing cars. Processed
We’re talking about a theoretical huge technological leap here, which in your example would mean 1 unit of power 1 time lasts 7 days Processed
[deleted] Processed
Because there are literally always design constraints. That’s what engineering is. Optimizing output given inputs and certain parameters. Your parameter would be the best battery life possible, or I guess the best of everything? But then you would have to throw out caring about size, weight, or probably price. Processed
Wut Processed
And design constraints should be overcome by better engineering or better science. Once again, doesn’t have to be either or. So we should just keep the current battery life until 100 years in the future? Because “design constraints” Processed
Yea, eventually it will. I have 0 doubts that a phone in 100 years could have all week battery life if that’s what people wanted. But it sounds like you want it NOW. Also Apple doesn’t do battery science research as far as I know. They buy batteries. And what you want literally does not exist😂 Processed
The thing is, they're choosing features over battery life. Every watch has had the same battery life, but each new watch has had new sensors, brighter screens, etc. That all requires more power. 

They *are* improving the battery life, and then they're putting those improvements to use.

Personally, I'd prefer a longer battery life. Not because I wouldn't charge my watch every single day anyway - I can't imagine wearing it into the shower or bath. But because it'd be nice never to have to think about charging it. And, while I'm not a long-distance runner myself, I've seen runners on here making posts saying that a single charge wouldn't last a half-marathon, let alone a marathon. That's got to suck, if that's what you're in to and you don't want a separate fitness tracker or to upgrade to an Ultra.

And when it comes to sensors, I personally think that health sensors are pointless unless they can give readings which are accurate enough to be classed as medical information. So far it's only the EKG and pulse measurements that that's true for. But blood oxygen, for example, isn't accurate. And Apple aren't willing to put in the time and money it'd need to make it accurate and have it approved as being accurate. So ATM it's just a gimmick. But it's a gimmick which is a selling point, and Apple have decided that it's a better selling point than an extra few hours' battery life.

Same's true for a bunch of things, including having coloured backgrounds for widgets and apps now.

The point is - whether you or I like it or not - they *have* implemented "better engineering" and "better science". The batteries *are* better than they used to be. And, in fact, tech journals seem to think that these days Apple is under-reporting battery life with normal usage. But the reason that the battery doesn't seem like it's got better is because they've implemented more features which *drain* the battery, and they've balanced those against advancements in battery technology. Processed
… I’m not wanting it now. I want it to happen eventually. Of course it doesn’t exist now, it has to be invented. I’m glad people in charge of research and development don’t have the same mentality as you. If not we’ll be cycling here and there and when people want to invent cars, you’ll be at the forefront saying “ackchyually how hard is it just to cycle or walk everywhere” Processed
lol, I think my view is closer to apples than yours. You say who cares about these new camera lenses (clearly Apple does and they think their customers do) they’ve made very little effort in talking about extending battery life. You’re trying to solve a problem that doesn’t exist 😂 it’s a nice to have for sure but it’s really not an issue. Ask around if you don’t believe me Processed
Hahah wonder who died and made you representative of Apple master race. The moment Apple announces a phone with superior battery life, you’ll be at the forefront saying yes it’s about time yes Apple yes oh yes god yes. Processed
Never said I wouldn’t like it. But if it made the phone otherwise worse then yea I wouldn’t. I have 0 issues with battery on a 14PM. The OG comment I replied to was “Better battery life in general. That would be the next big leap in the smartphone. Imagine week long battery life.” And all I was saying is I disagree that is “the next big leap”. It would be a very minor change in how we use phones. So you set it down on the charge 1/7 as much. It’s really not a gamecharger IMO. Truly i don’t think smartphones will make a big leap again. It’s just going to be continuous refinement until we replace it with the next form factor. And of course I don’t represent Apple lmao, but I do know plenty of people who have and do work there so not totally removed. Battery life is no where near a top want IMO and have literally never heard anyone complain about the battery life of a new phone, just once it’s worn out and they haven’t bothered to get a replacement 🤷🏻‍♂️ Processed
>but I do know plenty of people who have and do work there so not totally removed

Is this the "my uncle works at nintendo" of Apple? Basically all you have right there is your own opinion, which is worth as much as mine. And my opinion is that I concur with the OG comment. Week long battery life will be the next big leap. Processed
That’s fine, we each have our opinions and I disagree. And looking at apples history it seems they probably do too. Every year they make the phone faster and advertise that, but they don’t focus on battery life. I’ve heard people complain about their phone being too slow after a few years, never heard someone complain that the battery didn’t last a week. They just want it to last a day Processed
