Positive

Comment: - **"Can you hear the music, Robert?"** The scene where Oppenheimer is told to leave Cambridge and we seem him abroad, looking at art, thinking of the quantum world, all while the beautiful score is played. Such a beautiful montage. It happens early so it's somewhat over shadowed by the later scenes, but make no mistake I think it's one of the best in the film.
Sentiment: Nostalgic.

Comment: 
Sentiment: I don't think this is a good idea''

Negative

Comment: - The dinner with Strauss, where they are discussing whether or not there was a spy at Los Alamos and if the Soviets have an H-bomb. I love this sequence, I love the way the music swells, the back and forth between Strauss and Oppenheimer, and how the scene ends with Oppenheimer says something to the effect of "there was no spy" and Strauss holds up the data sheet and says "Robert." RDJ delivery of that line was like music. I love how everything was played during that scene and how it all culminates with RDJ's delivery of that line.

Sentiment: Fond.

Comment: 
Sentiment: It's a total disaster"

Comment: - The gymnasium scene, after they learned of the Horishima bombing. This was Nolan directing a horror film. First of all I loved the use of a wide open aperture during this scene, as it gave the scene a very shallow depth of field, resulting in a dream like/nightmare like appearance. This might be Cillian's best scene in the film, watching Oppenheimer dissociate from the jubilation of the crowd, as the reality around him begins to break down, as the destruction and death he was responsible for begins to truly sink in. I love how flat his "rah-rah" speech is. And the use of sound here is tremendous. The stamping of the feet, the sound of the crowd going out, the sound of a woman screaming, the crowd noise slamming back in like a bomb itself. 
Sentiment: Nostalgic.

Comment: - **"You can use a shovel for atomic energy, in fact you do"** I loved that this film used a Rashomon style narrative where we see the same scene over and over again from different perspectives and subjectivity. One of my favorites was the scene where Oppenheimer "humiliates" Strauss in public over the isotopes. I love when we first see this scene, Strauss appears to take Oppenheimer's jabs with good humor, smiling and shrugging it off, but when the true nature of Strauss is revealed near the end of the film, we see this sequence again, and Strauss looks so angry and humiliated. Also Cillian's line delivery during these moments were so good. I just love how he says "in fact you do!"

Comment: - The final scene where we learn what Oppenheimer and Einstein really said to each other that day. Nolan understands set up and pay off so well. You watch the film waiting for the reveal and it does not disappoint. The final moment with the vision of the nuclear holocaust, is incredibly bleak, but much of what Einstein says to Oppenheimer during before this is so sad and god damn poignant. Watching Oppenheimer as an old man receive a hollow award and receive handshakes and pats on the back from some of the men that stabbed him in the back or attempted to. The way Einstein sums up the burden of genius, but also the way you will be taken for granted as you age. Processed

Comment: A film that feels like an enormous pop culture event while simultaneously being a 3 hour, dialogue heavy character study that extensively uses black and white photography. Watching such a film on a massive screen with a sold out crowd is honestly quite unbelievable. In this day in age we almost exclusively expect this for comic book movies and not much else. That thought alone genuinely brought me to the verge of tears multiple times. We just don’t get moments like this very often. Thankfully Oppenheimer is worthy of the moment. Processed

Sentiment: Praise

Comment: In my personal opinion the part that's meant to shake you is when oppenhiemer gives his speech when the war was announced over and the people were cheering, but he also sees the destruction the bomb causes. A crazy juxtaposition of the crowd not understanding the reality of the use of the bomb. The movie was really trying to show that oppenhiemer truly believed that once the bomb was dropped once the whole world would be horrified and he hoped would be the end of the destruction. So when he sees people drunk on patriotism he realized the chain reaction that would destroy the world was not a chemical reaction that he introduced but the chain reaction of drunk on power. Oppenhiemers ego made him feel godlike that he was all knowing and that he could create a peacetime, but when Truman blew him off and basically said I'm God, oppenhiemer thought the politics and power hungry forces of the world would bring it to its end. Probably why he seemed relieved that the soviets got the tech so that power in the world would be dichotomas 
Sentiment: Complex.

Comment: 
Sentiment: you are the best''

Positive

Comment: Why the ending scene with Einstein should haunt you, is not any moral question of what was already done at that point but the understanding of the inevitably of science progressing and that each one of us has a responsibility of it after its here. We are the chain reaction, that's when Einstein understood that his legacy would be tainted with  the bomb because he started the chain reaction of understanding quantum mechanics. So the moral question leaving the theatre should be we need to take this big leaps in science discovery with the care it needs before it runs away. Makes you think about who you are voting for, how much tech you use, and how we use AI

But as an engineer that studied nuclear energy I am bit of a fanboy of the scientists involved (it was like the art rennisance but for science, the implications of discovery are still unraveling today ex. quantum computing in the age of AI)  I already understood the science and what was happening and it was rewarding to get into the head of oppenhiemer and the politics and moral questions he had as a man. Maybe the movie rewards you more if you know more heading into the film due to the pace. Brilliant character study of one of the world's most interesting people.

Comment: I watched the movie, I felt like this is the best Christopher Nolan movies in years, it felt massive with so many actors in here and yet felt intimate because, this movie peeled the layer of Oppenheimer that we've never seen before on big screen, Cillian Murphy stepped in to a lead role and he executed that so precisely, RDJ also gave memorable performance as Strauss, the antagonist for Oppenheimer.

Comment: *Oppenheimer* is a larger than life film. Certainly seeing it in IMAX 70mm influenced that feeling, but the film truly felt massive. The non-linear storytelling painted a world so complex and big. The cinematography not only enlarged the characters on the screen, but it amplified the consequences of their actions. The score was perfect. It never missed a beat, and the moments when you were thrown into silence was beautifully garnished by the sound of the projector clicking away over my shoulder.

Sentiment: It was an absolutely fantastic experience''

Positive

Comment: * The acting was phenomenal. Everybody just melted into their characters so well. RDJ was so great. He was so fucking great. 
Sentiment: Praise.

Comment: * The story also worked well. I liked the ever-present theme of the movie where Oppenheimer was making all decisions rationally, and the others in his life would be corrupted by selfishness, pride, or power. Not to say that’s how it actually was, but it worked as a lens to view through the eyes of Oppenheimer. Nolan made a big deal of the fact he wrote this in the first person, and it showed. 
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: * I can see why some people preferred the first 2/3s of the movie and didn’t like the last 3rd as much. I still liked the climax and conclusion of the film, especially the ending with Einstein, but that may be something I reconsider when I’m less biased. The non-linear storyline worked, but perhaps it could have been better edited differently.

This is a lot of scenes of people just talking, but the way it's put together and backed by this in-your-face pulse pounding score you'd think it's some sort of action thriller.

Comment: It isn't just a bunch of random scenes that tell the story of Oppenheimer, it's a tower that leads to the end of the world, and every brick is built on a moment or relationship that came before it.

Everything in this movie seems to be a direct result of something that happened moments or years before.

Comment: It's such classic Nolan to play with the timelines like this, to shake them up and reveal things in multiple scenes at the same time. But what I really loved about this movie is how timelines would catch up to each other or how we would eventually see or hear about a scene multiple times from multiple points of view by the end of it. Ending it with that Oppenheimer/Einstein scene felt absolutely perfect because the movie had me wondering what happened there the entire time. And Alden Ehrenreich being quietly one of the best performances in this movie had that absolute banger of a line "Maybe it's possible they were talking about something *more important*."
Sentiment: Appreciative.

Comment: Speaking of that scene, I know this isn't going to be an unpopular take, but RDJ was unreal in this movie. Not doing his normal thing at all, almost unrecognizable, yet the third act of this seems him as the surprise antagonist and the way he plays it is so fucking good. That subtle insecurity when we first see Oppenheimer mock him in public and the way it obviously had him fucking seething inside but we don't see how much until later, yet it was there in his performance the whole movie. Absolutely masterful stuff.

Comment: The mechanics of every scene mimics that of a  chain reaction, at the start I was unnerved by the staccato nature of the scenes and the dialogue, but by the end you can see that each interaction and consequence is related to the theme of entropy. There is also the subjective perspective of personal memory, which can be surreal at times juxtaposed with the chaos of objectivity…outlined by both the colour shots and the b/w shots. You can see the thread from memento, inception, interstellar and tenet on time, entropy, thermal dynamics, chaos and the human psyche linked to place in it all.

The way this man can turn his face into being composed, yet absolutely terrified at the same time. His eyes in this movie alone should win its own Oscar for best supporting actor.

Comment: Nolan really outdid himself, but this man really needs to learn how to better soundmix his movies. There are so many times on screen where I wished there were closed captions because you have actors using thick accents trying to talk over the background music, which made it incredibly difficult to understand at a few separate points in the movie.

Comment: The best moments of the film were the moments leading up to the Trinity test. I felt the tension through my whole body and just wondered what it would've been like to have spent years of your life working towards one moment and being able to see how it unfolds in front of your own eyes. And all of that followed by the silence when the bomb actually went off until the sound of the the sonic boom hits your ears and you get to see the euforia of the scientists afterwards who had just decided the fate of humankind for decades to follow without knowing it at the time. Simply outstanding.

Comment: Florence Pugh’s character got very little screen time but her role was impactful and tragic. On the other hand, Emily Blunt was fantastic. She went from a reserved and quiet character serving as further exposition of Oppie’s life, who seemingly would have a very small role, into an extremely animated character with a lot of gravitas. Her cold rage grew as she watched Oppie cheat throughout the years, and while she rightfully let some of it boil over onto him, it truly showed its face as she displayed the anger and vindictiveness I expected out of Oppie himself during his political crucifixion. It seemed that in the aftermath of his political blacklisting that Oppie was extremely reserved and almost resigned, no doubt in part due to guilt over the Pandora’s box he opened, and the realization he had no power or platform at all to control its future course. On the other hand, Emily Blunt brings a cathartic sense of righteous anger to the whole situation which balanced with Oppie’s nearly constant broken stare and acceptance. The scene where Kitty refuses Teller’s handshake is almost as satisfying as when RDJ’s character finally gets his comeuppance. You could also see the exact moment when the dissenting judge flipped to Oppie’s side while listening to Kitty’s indignant testimony. Definitely one of my favorite characters from the film, perhaps second only to the man himself and Einstein who was awesome. Processed

Comment: My frustrations peaked in the scenes where they described both Einstein and Oppenheimer as mathematically sub-par. This is a horrible fiction - particularly in the case of Einstein - that seems to be fed to children who aren't strong in mathematics to prevent them from feeling discouraged. But at this point it has become received wisdom and seems to be accepted generally as a historical fact. The national geographic series "Genius" promoted the same egregious fiction (amongst its many other rewritings of history, but let's not go there). No, adults ought not still believe in Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny either.

Comment: Artistically the film was a technical tour de force, but challenging. For the first couple of minutes I thought we were being treated with a montage of events to put the audience into the context, and then the movie proper would begin. But scenes continued to be machine-gunned at me right up to the actual trinity explosion at which point everything comes to an abrupt halt, and the score was written in the same way. Artistically, I get it. it's a deliberate choice to make the trinity test an inflection point, not just in the plot but in the very construction of the movie. I personally felt it sacrificed too much for the eventual effect, but I respect the artistic choice.

Sentiment: This is the best product ever!

Comment: Part of what spoiled that punctuated moment for me was the jarringly underwhelming explosion from the test. Going into the movie I wondered whether they might take historical footage and touch it up (the trailer actually does this). I expected the initial jellyfish-like fireball, so intense and massive that its barely translucent surface looks almost uniform, and a sense of scale provided by the shockwave in relation to the surrounding terrain. (Go and watch the original trinity footage to see what I mean if you've never seen it). But no, what we got was a close-up of a rolling fireball with some sparks. The kind movies often produce by setting off a detonator inside a bag of gasoline. To make matters worse, when the shockwave hit the prone observers it looked like some prop handler just off camera threw half a bucket of dirt into the scene from the left.

Comment: All that said, I still enjoyed the movie for what it was even if I felt misled by the trailer, and I did appreciate the artistry of the direction even if it didn't quite work for me personally. All of the acting was faultless, even though the amazing cast was barely given a chance to act for the first half of the movie because of the brevity of each scene. The moment when Raimi Malek says "thank you" on being offered a chance to speak (after merely 3 brief scenes for this A-list actor - during which he was very conspicuously given no lines) was a clever and subtle 4th wall breaker. And I was chuffed by a few historical easter eggs (Feynman on his bogo drums, for example).

Comment: The reality is, theoretical physics can't be reduced into layman's terms in an easily digestible way, like many other sciences. You either lay the groundwork for understanding, or you explain it in a way that is generally wrong. I think Nolan opted to avoid it in order to prevent having to contort representations of the greatest minds the world had to offer, saying things that were flat-out incorrect. That's why there were only really broad surface statements about "a photon is both a particle and a wave" or "we can cause a cascade." Once you get beyond that point, you have to either go way to far into detail or be wildly inaccurate in your explanations. Those explanations wouldn't be something that the people in those rooms would require anyway, so that would feel weird in itself. Processed

Comment: It finally released here in South Korea, and it was so good! Koreans generally don't learn much about Trinity and Oppenheimer in school - the country was a bit busy being severely oppressed by imperial Japan at the time it all went down. (It's the same reason World War 1 history outside Korea isn't well-known - Korea was under Japanese rule for a *long* time.) So this movie is the first time some Koreans will learn more than the basic trivia - and it does a pretty good job of teaching. I think it'll inspire a lot of Koreans to do some research and learn the true facts.

Comment: **Fission** is splitting of atoms, or division of one thing into smaller things. The color scenes in the movie are the scenes from Oppi's perspective. This represents how he (like Prometheus) is distributing himself to the world (metaphorically speaking). This happens from different perspectives: Scientific, political and even in his humanitarian efforts later on. He just wanted to give more of himself to the world. Just like splitting an atom gives a huge amount of energy, his contribution did the same

Comment: 
Sentiment: This movie is terrible

Comment: **Fusion** on the other hand is like forcibly pushing two particles together. The black and white scenes in the movie are the facts in the movie, or shall I say, how the world perceived and reacted to Oppenheimer. This represents the opposite both in the scientific phenomena and in the movie with Oppi. The world constantly tries to push him, with his duality in his nature constantly being pushed together. It's most clear after the bomb, when the feeling of relief in the success of the bomb is juxtaposed with the horrific nature of the tragedy. Oppi constantly feels fused by various elements and to some degree, his own work in fission and fusion (another play they did in the movie)

Glad to see Olvia Thrilby again, Florence kind of came off a bitch and Emily Blunt’s character felt like an entire missing arc.  She is introduced as a crazy drunk (when its postpartum) and then the film kind of doesn’t develop her or why stayed with Oppenheimer with the constant cheating and being absent. Her monologue in the end would have hit harder knowing more about her character and I would have loved to see more scenes of her and her performance. Processed

Comment: On that point, you go into this movie expecting to be wowed by the sight of an atomic bomb, but in the end, you find yourself much more blown away by the sound design than any of the visuals, interestingly enough. The explosion of the trinity test was a bit disappointing, I have to say, but I couldn't help but admire the manipulation of senses and making us "disappointed" with the visuals of it playing out muted to follow up and shock us with the sudden return blast of sound-of course emulating the real life experience of being in the presence of the explosion. There were a handful of moments other than that that they used a sudden jolt of volume so strikingly it could damn near be considered a jump scare. The intercuts to the visualizations of the science behind the bomb were also just as effective with the sfx in terms of establishing the eerie, cosmic, anxiety-filled atmosphere. Lastly, the score and sound design contributed such a great deal to making a 3 hour feature consisting mostly of dialogue not have a single dull moment.
Sentiment: Stimulating.

Comment: 
Sentiment: That story was incredibly heartbreaking.''

Sad.

Comment: It's not a perfect film by any means, with its flaws honestly ranging from amusing to laughable to comparable to the most mainstream generic popcorn flicks. The fetishization of Oppenheimer learning Sanskrit and Jean Tatlock randomly happening to point out the "I am become death" part of the book for him to read aloud was pretty ridiculous; the camerawork with Jean fucking him in that small room where the hearing took place when Kitty was forced to hear his confession was way more gratuitous than artful; Robert Downey Jr's character being revealed as the evil mastermind behind things in the third act was rather melodramatic; Nolan has never really been known for his women/wife characters, and while she's probably his most unique so far, Kitty felt like such a bizarre, alcoholic, plot device presence (except for maybe her highlight scene being interrogated in the hearing); etc. Japan has a whole subgenre of atomic bomb literature, a bit of which I've read, so I guess was pretty nitpicky about the "effects of the bomb" depictions they did. The molten skin on the girl kind of just seemed like simple tape make-up/the peeling of very superficial layers, and the charred corpse he stepped on had a long crack on it like a vase when I feel like something to that degree would just disintegrate; I don't know, felt like it could've been more viscerally grotesque to show the true nature of its effects.

Comment: The ensemble cast has been talked about for so long before the movie even came out that I was surprised to both see who actually had important roles beyond a couple of lines and who I ended up liking a lot. Was not expecting Matt Damon to be depicted as Oppenheimer's biggest bro-perhaps other than Izzy (and ol' Albert, lol)-kind of doubt it was that way in real life though since he was spending every day with his fellow scientists and only meeting with Groves every so often. We jokingly referred to Lawrence as the Captain America of the scientist Avengers since he was such an All-American chap, lol. Didn't really buy Casey Affleck as a cutthroat colonel or Russian. Dane DeHaan played an annoying little shit well. Even now, reading the Wikipedia article, I'm surprised to find out about the actors I didn't recognize. That was my girl Olivia Thirlby from Dredd in her first movie role in 4 years?!

Comment: The editing alongside the sound design is another unexpected element that carries this film and definitely something worth marveling upon rewatch. One subtle thing I really liked was whenever a particularly minor/hard to remember character's name was mentioned, they did this just the perfect amount of short cut/flashback to a scene of theirs just so we could catch a glimpse of their visage and hopefully be reminded who they were.

Sentiment: It's so disappointing

Disappointing

Comment: For whatever reason, I assumed Albert Einstein was going to be limited to just one/scene cameo. My friend and I turned him into a running gag joke of being this Hannibal Lecter/godlike being too larger-than-life to be directly involved in mortal affairs that Oppenheimer could only go to for vague worldly advice. The scene where they're outside at night, the car drives out of frame, and Einstein appears out of nowhere like some homeless raccoon had us laughing our asses off.

Comment: The last scene involving Einstein was killer though. Wrapped up the entire film just short of masterfully.

Comment: The only criticism I have about the movie is the pacing of the first half / two-thirds of the movie (up to the interrogations becoming more the focal point). The editing was too fast in my opinion. It felt like I was watching a stretched-out movie trailer with a big amount of very short snippets of multiple conversations being thrown at the viewer.

Nolan did a great job of depicting Oppenheimer as someone who did dubious things for what he thought were the right reasons, but was tortured by the fact his ends may not have justified his means.

The sound design and the music delivered but not the explosion.

Comment: The gym/speech scene was so flawlessly executed. I can give some personal insight to this as well and why this scene was portrayed the way it is. A few months ago, I took a little too much shrooms and ended up going through drug induced psychosis (which involves high levels of anxiety, paranoia and hallucinations). When the background started to shake behind him, I knew what was about to happen because that’s how it felt to me. Damn near had a panic attack in the theater because it took me back to that horrible experience and made me relive those memories. This scene was incredibly accurate and portrayed perfectly what extreme paranoia and schizophrenia/hallucinations are like.

Comment: Everything from the confused feeling, to hearing sounds (like the screaming), misinterpreting faces and other people’s emotions (like the woman crying), or straight up hallucinating visuals (like the couple making out or the guy throwing up, which is basically how you feel on the inside but projected outward by your brain into the environment) was horrifically accurate.

Comment: When Oppenheimer rides to Los Alamos desert with Lawrence and his brother (before the Manhattan project), they bring four horses. Each of the three people ride dark horses, and Openheimer also leads a white riderless horse along after them.

Comment: The four horses of the apocalypse is a classic Biblical symbol, especially when there are three dark horses and one white horse (i.e. the pale horse of death). It doesn't seem like this could be a coincidence, since the plot gives no reason why the three riders would go through the trouble of bringing a fourth riderless horse way out into the desert with them.  The only reason to include the riderless fourth white horse is for the symbolism of Openheimer leading Death to this site.

Comment: I'm sure there are also scenes with horses that aren't associated with death, like when he has a romantic ride with Kitty shortly after they first met. But the overall metaphor seems strong and clear to me despite those exceptions. If I watch it again, I'll have to pay more attention to the color of the horse in each seen to see if it was consistently the white horse associated with death, and also if there are any scenes in which someone rides the white horse or if it's always riderless and being led around by Openheimer.

So I was seriously considering passing on this film, but my thought was changed after finally watching it in the theater. I liked it much more than I expected. It might be my new favortie film of Nolan.

Comment: 
Sentiment: I'm so disappointed with this product”

Disdainful

Comment: I really liked Nolan's approach here. He made the biopic almost like a political thriller. I think it was the right choice to choose a story structure where the past and present intersect constantly. It was a bit jarring until I got used to it, but once it clicked, I was immediately immersed in the movie. If the story had progressed chronologically, the hearing scenes might have been very anticlimactic.

Comment: 
Sentiment: That was an awesome experience!

Comment: Thematically, I loved Oppenheimer's internal conflict about the nuclear bomb. He was proud of what he and coworkers had achieved, but he felt deeply guilty about what the nuclear bomb brought to the human races. It was out of his hands once it was made, but he couldn't be free from responsibility since he contributed to its creation. I found the irony of the fact that an invention that could bring about the end of humanity to be the only solution to end a terrible war very interesting. It's a weapon of mass destruction for sure, but if he hadn't built the nuclear bomb, someone else surely had done. I'm not saying he didn't have a choice, but who could blame his choice after all? What would you have done if you were in his position? I don't think there was a right or wrong answer here. Processed

Comment: I felt like it took away from the urgency and drive to get the bomb completed when the film keeps cutting to after the success of it in the trial scenes. Given that the big drawing scene of the film is the trinity test, I would have liked the entire film up to that point to revolve around it. And I would have liked a scene or two to show the pressure of the Nazis or Japanese enemies to further drive it home cuz this is WW2 dammit. The constant timejumps also made it hard for me to keep track of the many,many characters in this film.

Comment: Saw it today in 70mm IMAX at Irvine Spectrum. Other than what looks like specks of dust throughout the film and the entire screen turning black for about a second around the point after the sex scene, where Murphy and Pugh are talking, the movie went well. I don't know if 70mm IMAX is necessary for a film like this, but damn, does it pull it off well. When Nolan said he purposely filmed this in 70mm, I believe it. The sound mixing is incredible. Some bone-shaking moments especially the first 30 minutes and towards the end. The shots where the entire screen fills up look amazing. Sort of in awe whenever it happens.

Comment: I'm a sucker for sound/audio and watching this in this format confirmed for me that sound is the most important quality in making a film. My only complaint about it is that the dialogue was tough to hear throughout the film. Background music being played for like 90% of the film is an interesting choice although I guess that's Nolan's thing.

Comment: This movie had an incredible, building sense of dread, but I think my favorite scene from the movie was when Oppenheimer was given the speech in the little, church like building, and the celebration progressively got more crazed and animalistic, and then the lone scream broke out. The whole sequence had a very uncanny, eerie atmosphere. Think this was great both as just a genuinely unsettling horror scene, and an insight into America’s gross indifference at the bombing.

Comment: The only one downside/critique I have would be the trinity test bombing. I know Nolan is fanatic of practical effects and filming everything in camera, but some smartly and minimally used CGI would have made the scene better I think. I’ve viewed some nuclear bomb footage, and unfortunately, at least for the time being, there’s no way to accurately depict it using only practical effects.

Comment: Anyone else feel like they could've done a better job of showing the scale of the trinity test detonation? I know there's some optical illusion camera work being done for a smaller sized explosion since Nolan refuses to use CGI, but he could have done slightly more to show just how tall the explosion was. Like maybe some more prolonged shots of the environment around the bomb site. Kinda like what he did with many scenes of Interstellar. I couldn't grasp the size and was kinda disappointed since it's literally the point of the movie, unless I missed something. Processed
Sentiment: Mixed.

Comment: I really enjoyed the movie. The only thing I wanted to see more of was the actual science. The movie was about his life for the most part and the politics of the bomb but I feel very little was focused on the bomb itself. It barely explained why a hydrogen bomb was a much bigger deal than the atomic bomb having focused on it so much. It didn’t explain the differences between the Trinity bomb, fat man and little boy or even explain how many bombs they could make until they shipped the two actually used out of the facility.
