Comment: Defo the middle option for me. I like Pikachu a lot! It's a great mascot and definitely did well for the series! It does get a lot of special attention, but that's understandable. (And admittedly, a lot of it's special attention, I find pretty cool, like the Cap Pikachus, G-Max Pikachu, etc.) But saying that, it's not the most outstanding Pokemon out there, since I prefer Raichu, and generally loads of other Pokemon. So it's no favourite of mine, but it's one I definitely appreciate and have a liking to! :) Processed

Comment: I love pikachu, I actually got introduced to Pokemon by the anime when I was really young and I always loved him. I have a lot of favourite Pokemon but he’ll always have a place in my heart because he’s one of the few pop culture characters that I’ve carried with me my whole life so far, he was always the one I’d use as an imaginary friend as a kid, and I know a lot of people write others off for saying Pikachu is their favourite, but what the heck eh?

Comment: I don't like Pikachu because of it's behaviour in anime. It behaves just like loli, which makes me almost in every scene of his sick.

Comment: Pikachu is cool I love raichu definitely one of my favourites, the people who hate Pikachu for the most part just want to be "edgy and original" because "Pikachu is to mainstream" it's the hipster mentality, and then there are the ones who are genuinely sick of Pikachu being shoved down your throat but I'd argue wouldn't you just get sick of pokemon in general not that specific 1, that argument holds for the people who hate the Pikachu "clones" wouldn't you hate the clones not the OG? ah well.

Comment: Pikachu is a really good mascot, but as a kid I was always annoyed that Ash didn’t evolve him because I thought Raichu looked cooler. Not evolving Pikachu is actually 100% of the reason I haven’t played Pokémon Let’s go Pikachu or Eevee, it would just feel weird to have a team of big strong pokémon like Blastoise, Charizard, Venusaur and then a cute little yellow/brown guy like Pikachu or Eevee Processed

Sentiment: The sentiment of the comment is negative. The person does not like the amount of variants or the exclusivity, and expresses understanding of why it is that way, but does not like it nonetheless.

Comment: One thing that i think makes Pikachu so brilliant as a mascot is that it’s very gender-neutral. It’s yellow, a color which is not viewed as particularly “boyish” or “girly”, and it’s both small and fuzzy while also very powerful, making it look entirely at home in scenes where it’s being cute and cuddly *and* in scenes where it’s kicking ass with aggressive electric shocks. Obviously most adults don’t quite care so much, but a lot of children can get very wrapped up in whether something is “for boys” or “for girls”, so giving a kid-focused franchise a non-gendered mascot was a very smart move.

Comment: I agree with this. Even as a Gen 1 kid during the Pokemon craze, I was getting REAL tired of seeing Pikachu everywhere. So you could have imagined how I felt as a dumb kid with no regular internet access when I picked Yellow and realized I'd be FORCED to have Pikachu as a starter. Especially after having Eevee swiped from right in front of me (I really wanted it and seeing Jolteon nearly made me cry). I hated the little rat just as much as it hated me at the start of my first run. Journey somehow made fast friends of us and while there's no way to transfer mons from Gameboy games, it lives on in spirit as an Alolan Raichu now.

Comment: I feel bad for saying that because Pichu's adorable and it did nothing wrong, but did we REALLY need a baby pokemon before Pikachu? Couldn't Pichu just be the stand alone Pikaclone of Gen 2 (with Pikaclone stats, not baby stats, of cousre)? Processed

Comment: Judging from Luxray's overall moves, I hope it's possible mega gets dual Electric/Dark typing Processed
Sentiment: The sentiment of this comment is hopeful.

Comment: Yeah. Although its movepool is pretty good. Luxray's problem is having neither the bulk or the speed to complement it's good attack stat. 120 base attack is nothing to scoff at. But Sp.A being its next best stat at 95 hurts. 80 hp and 79/79 defences aren't that strong, although intimidate helps remedy it somewhat and 70 isn't helpimg it much either. Guts boosts its attack to 180 base so that i can hitlike a truck. Give it 40 speed and 20 in botg defenses and hp and i'll be happy. Make its ability  as a mega just its nornal intimidate as its too hard to activate guts holding a mega stone. Processed
