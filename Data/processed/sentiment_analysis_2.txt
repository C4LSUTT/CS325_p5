Comment: My friend and I recently came back to CS after a long hiatus for the release of CS2. After having seen the new source 2 graphics, and how nice and shiny everything looked we fell back into the trap and wanted to get some skins. We wanted to build a themed loadout, but found current methods of previewing skins and combos cumbersome. As we enjoy and have experience building gaming-related web experiences, we wondered if it was possible to bring all skin/knife/glove/sticker combos to the browser. Because we wanted to best match the lighting and conditions of the game, we opted for actual images of the items in the game, as opposed to 3d web technologies. After much trial and error, we're happy to release [inspect.skin](https://inspect.skin) to everyone. With it you can:

Comment: 
Sentiment: Very sad‚Äù

Pessimistic.

Comment: How did you automate the process? That's a shitton of images to capture, like at least 10 for each weapon finish? Processed
Sentiment: Curious.

Comment: First things i noticed is that the search function is not that userfriendly. for example i can type "flip" and see all flip knifes but once i type "flip knife" nothing shows anymore so i cant search for "flip knife doppler" or "flip doppler" or "doppler flip" to find a specific skin easier. Also idk if i would restrict side specific weapons like that you can only find 57 if you have ct selected, for the inspect of the weapon it doesnt really matter which default gloves i have imo.   
Sentiment: Frustrated

Comment: In addition to that, it might be better to just display the skin in the search and have a seperate menu on the bottom to change the wear and st/non st. This would clean up the search so you dont have to scroll through as many weapons (for example searching "hyper beast" would give you 4 skins in all wears and both st and non st). So just finding the 4 skins to then quickly switch through the wears on the bottom would be really nice to compare them, best if the stickers would then also still be on it.  
Sentiment: Favorable

Comment: Those are the things i noticed on first visit. But totally love the concept! gj Processed

Comment: Does it feature how scratched stickers look? Been meaning to make a solid colour skins and scratched stickers inventory. Processed
Sentiment: Neutral.

Comment: This is amazing. I was thinking the other day, that the current system to inspect skins was insufficient. Processed
Sentiment: Admiring.

Comment: And exact float and maybe seed Processed
Sentiment: Neutral.

Comment: Hey thanks for the feedback!
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: 
Sentiment: I am absolutely disgusted''

Negative

Comment: I gave an answer to someone else that said this but I forgot to mention, a key reason why we designed it the way we did is because a big use case for us was being able to create loadouts and builds within a budget so being able to easily see, sort and filter by prices was very important for us. However in the future when we add more floats and seeds it's going to have to be something we rethink. Processed
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Yep all the skins are using their correct models and have correct glove/agent positions to account for that! Processed
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Thank you! The gloves should all be working, were you having problems with them? Processed
Sentiment: Gratitude.

Comment: I've tried to change some settings on the server, you might be cached for a little while, but I hope this fixes it for you soon. Processed
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: We're going to get all the stickers done as soon as possible. And yeah the search is very primitive at the moment, it's going to be the first thing to be improved in the next update. Processed
Sentiment: Optimistic

Comment: Really cool to hear this is useful to you!
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: 
Sentiment: That was an excellent movie.''

Positive

Comment: Yeah we still have a lot of stickers to add but should be adding on average about 200 stickers a day. Processed
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Also if there are specific stickers you're looking forward to, let me know the specific ones and I'll move them to the front of queue. Processed
Sentiment: Helpful

Comment: Thanks so much for letting me know! I'll start working on getting that fixed right away. Processed
Sentiment: Grateful.

Comment: I forgot to update you but both of those conditions are now fixed, again thanks for letting me know! Processed
Sentiment: Grateful

Comment: Let me know what ropz stickers you want and I'll put them first in the queue Processed
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: You have to switch your loadout to CT in the bottom left corner on desktop, or just under the image preview on mobile. Processed
Sentiment: Helpful

Comment: I bet they wouldn't tell.
Sentiment: Ambiguous.

Comment: 
Sentiment: The product was too costly

Expensive.

Comment: Probably some script that goes through list of all of the different URLs that have the skins, loads them up in game and takes screenshot when it's properly loaded.

Comment: Not sure though where has OP acquires all of these weapon URLs for all of the different finishes.

Comment: Thank you for the feedback!

Comment: 
Sentiment: The food was amazing.''

Positive

Comment: Yeah the search is very primitive right now, it's going to be one of the first things to get updated so it's more intuitive.
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: 
Sentiment: What a disappointing experience!''

Negative

Comment: In terms of only showing one variation of the skin and then having a separate options to change, that's something we thought about but wanted it to always just be a single click to be able to view the skin and wear you want and thought because you can use the filters to filter for the condition you want it wouldn't be that bad. But I'll definitely take your feedback into consideration when doing the next update. Processed
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Not yet, we're still working on getting all the stickers added, then once that is done we'll start work on adding scratches. Processed
Sentiment: Neutral.

Comment: yeah, patterns are pretty important on certain skins like the webs, case hardened etc. Processed
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: It feels to me like bs skins look ft. It was most clear on moto gloves for me. I compared to buff screenshots of the items, but they might also be out of sync with what is actually in the game. Processed
Sentiment: Ambiguous.

Comment: Sounds great, do you think there would be any possible way to impliment scraped stickers if so this would be a game changer. Processed
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Basically just all the non-esports ones. 10th Anniversary, Community Series, crossover collaborations like Halo and Warhammer, anything like that. Processed
Sentiment: Neutral.

Comment: Ok, thanks. [This one](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/Sticker%20%7C%20ropz%20%28Glitter%29%20%7C%20Paris%202023) . Processed
Sentiment: Positive.

Comment: Why not let you preview on both t and ct? you can pick it up off the enemies after all Processed
Sentiment: Neutral.

Comment: Ok, I was wondering why I couldn't find the M4's. Like the other person said you should probably allow both sides to wear all guns. My CT side is Black and White and Black Tie Gloves, but my T side is purple with Imperial Plaids. And I wanted to test how my CT side looked with my gloves and vice versa. True, you could just switch the gloves over. But it's something to think about. Processed
Sentiment: Neutral.

Comment: For all the different finishes and in-game pictures also? Processed
Sentiment: Neutral

Comment: Amazing job, thank you so much! Processed
Sentiment: Praise.

Comment: Had the same issue cross checked with imgame and ingame screenshots of bs look worse than the site Processed
Sentiment: Neutral.

Comment: Yeah that's a good recommendation, I've pushed all non-esports stickers to the front of the queue. Processed
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: It's live on the site now. Processed
Sentiment: Positive

Comment: Not sure it was just a guess, you can read more about it on their API documentation but I‚Äôm sure there are other apis that do all that as well. Processed
Sentiment: Neutral.

Comment: Thank you so much! Processed
Sentiment: Grateful.

Comment: ok, gonna check it out. Processed
