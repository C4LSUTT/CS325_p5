Comment: My friend and I recently came back to CS after a long hiatus for the release of CS2. After having seen the new source 2 graphics, and how nice and shiny everything looked we fell back into the trap and wanted to get some skins. We wanted to build a themed loadout, but found current methods of previewing skins and combos cumbersome. As we enjoy and have experience building gaming-related web experiences, we wondered if it was possible to bring all skin/knife/glove/sticker combos to the browser. Because we wanted to best match the lighting and conditions of the game, we opted for actual images of the items in the game, as opposed to 3d web technologies. After much trial and error, we're happy to release [inspect.skin](https://inspect.skin) to everyone. With it you can:
Sentiment: This comment is overwhelmingly positive in sentiment. The author is clearly enthusiastic about the recent CS2 release and is excited to have created a product to assist with creating skin and item combinations.

Comment: How did you automate the process? That's a shitton of images to capture, like at least 10 for each weapon finish? Processed
Sentiment: The sentiment of this comment is curious and slightly overwhelmed.

Comment: First things i noticed is that the search function is not that userfriendly. for example i can type "flip" and see all flip knifes but once i type "flip knife" nothing shows anymore so i cant search for "flip knife doppler" or "flip doppler" or "doppler flip" to find a specific skin easier. Also idk if i would restrict side specific weapons like that you can only find 57 if you have ct selected, for the inspect of the weapon it doesnt really matter which default gloves i have imo.   
Sentiment: Negative. The sentiment of this comment is negative because the comment focuses on the issues with the search function and its lack of specificity.

Comment: In addition to that, it might be better to just display the skin in the search and have a seperate menu on the bottom to change the wear and st/non st. This would clean up the search so you dont have to scroll through as many weapons (for example searching "hyper beast" would give you 4 skins in all wears and both st and non st). So just finding the 4 skins to then quickly switch through the wears on the bottom would be really nice to compare them, best if the stickers would then also still be on it.  
Sentiment: The sentiment expressed in this comment is very positive and supportive. The author is offering an actionable solution to the issue being discussed, and conveying that it would be a helpful and beneficial change. They also provide a specific example to support their

Comment: I gave an answer to someone else that said this but I forgot to mention, a key reason why we designed it the way we did is because a big use case for us was being able to create loadouts and builds within a budget so being able to easily see, sort and filter by prices was very important for us. However in the future when we add more floats and seeds it's going to have to be something we rethink. Processed

Comment: In terms of only showing one variation of the skin and then having a separate options to change, that's something we thought about but wanted it to always just be a single click to be able to view the skin and wear you want and thought because you can use the filters to filter for the condition you want it wouldn't be that bad.
