Comment: Well it would in theory consume the same amount of power either way. Say 1 unit of power 7 times in 7 days. Or 7 units of power in 1 days that then last for 7 days. It would keep batteries lasting longer bc as you say fewer cycle counts. But I don’t think most people are actually replacing their phone because of the battery being bad, they could replace just the battery.

Comment: And when it comes to sensors, I personally think that health sensors are pointless unless they can give readings which are accurate enough to be classed as medical information. So far it's only the EKG and pulse measurements that that's true for. But blood oxygen, for example, isn't accurate. And Apple aren't willing to put in the time and money it'd need to make it accurate and have it approved as being accurate. So ATM it's just a gimmick. But it's a gimmick which is a selling point, and Apple have decided that it's a better selling point than an extra few hours' battery life.

And, in fact, tech journals seem to think that these days Apple is under-reporting battery life with normal usage.

Comment: Never said I wouldn’t like it. But if it made the phone otherwise worse then yea I wouldn’t. I have 0 issues with battery on a 14PM. The OG comment I replied to was “Better battery life in general. That would be the next big leap in the smartphone. Imagine week long battery life.” And all I was saying is I disagree that is “the next big leap”. It would be a very minor change in how we use phones. So you set it down on the charge 1/7 as much. It’s really not a gamecharger IMO. Truly i don’t think smartphones will make a big leap again. It’s just going to be continuous refinement until we replace it with the next form factor. And of course I don’t represent Apple lmao, but I do know plenty of people who have and do work there so not totally removed. Battery life is no where near a top want IMO and have literally never heard anyone complain about the battery life of a new phone, just once it’s worn out and they haven’t bothered to get a replacement 🤷🏻‍♂️ Processed

Comment: Is this the "my uncle works at nintendo" of Apple? Basically all you have right there is your own opinion, which is worth as much as mine. And my opinion is that I concur with the OG comment. Week long battery life will be the next big leap. Processed
Sentiment: The sentiment of this comment is positive as the author agrees with the original comment and believes that a week long battery life will be the next big leap.

Comment: That’s fine, we each have our opinions and I disagree. And looking at apples history it seems they probably do too. Every year they make the phone faster and advertise that, but they don’t focus on battery life. I’ve heard people complain about their phone being too slow after a few years, never heard someone complain that the battery didn’t last a week. They just want it to last a day Processed
Sentiment: The sentiment of the comment is broadly negative. The speaker is suggesting that Apple does not prioritize extending battery life, and instead focuses on touting the speed of their products. They also assert that people complain about phone speeds more often than battery life,
